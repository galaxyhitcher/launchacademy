				Fluid, liquid, responsive, elastic, hybrid... how's a front end developer supposed to know which to use? As you'll see, they're very similar in what they do, but with minor differences between them. You'll also hear people use one and mean another, so it's good to know what techniques can be employed to achieve any of the layout types.

      <div id="sidebar">
        <!-- placeholder content -->
				Since we've already covered how responsive design works using breakpoints to change the content to fit screen widths, we'll focus on liquid and fluid layouts. Liquid layouts typically employ percentage values for widths to maintain the same width ratios for content areas as the browser width changes. Let's create a basic example of a liquid layout. Start with a basic HTML page, then add two columns for a main content area and a sidebar. Add some placeholder text content (lipsum is the standard) and save the file. Now we'll add CSS to set the columns to float along side each other and set the widths to percentages to make sure they adjust to fit the browser window.
