make sure each field is required - go into forms guide on developer.mozilla.org
most browsers that support the required attribute will not submit the form until all required fields are filled out
required is a boolean attribute
action - where the form submits to
back end - receives this data
method does not matter
fieldset element - groups all fields together - have a definition list/ series of definition lists
label is definition term, definition is input - makes a lot of sense semantically
first input is user's name (assume full name)
name will be a text field
(input is a self-closing tag)
email type gives the browser the option to display a different keyboard tailored to email input
why both a name and an id attribute on these fields?

the name attribute is used to pair up with the content entered into this field

the browser defines the params in the url using the text inputted into the fields
the next field is for the phone number
type="tel" (tel is short for telephone)

Finally, we have a message which will be represented by a textarea.

since we want to be able to enter multiple lines of content, we will use a textarea
optional attributes you probably want to set:

rows="6"
cols="80"
(i.e. 80 characters wide and 6 characters tall)

This will not be a self-closing element.
most browsers will let you change the size of the textarea, however, the minimum size is defined by the rows and cols attributes.

value attribute defines the default content of the field.
reset triggers browser-specific behavior.

if we had a value attribute, i.e. value="Shane", and we hit the reset, it would reset that field to "Shane"

if the form action is empty, the submit input type will simply reset the page.
