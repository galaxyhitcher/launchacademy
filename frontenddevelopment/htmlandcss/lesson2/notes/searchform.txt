create a search form w/ field element for search term & group of elements to select 'TV', 'Movies', or 'Music'

have a form element inside a fieldset
create a form without a definition list
(label then input)

label what we're looking for in the corresponding input
input specifically for search (i.e. input type="search")

slightly rounded corners in searchbar (Google Chrome)
x control clears out the search field

autocomplete

javascript plugins website grunt

user can clear a search input in one action

we need radio elements - label with no for attribute, name="filter", value="tv"
with a radio button, the user is toggling the input.

add a button that does not submit the form we click
- add an input with a type of button instead of submit

you are going to attach a form processing behavior in javascript instead of sending the form to the server

update on the page instead of reloading it.
