Getting Started
1.) create a basic sinatra app in a file called cms.rb and add boilerplate code for a basic sinatra app with sessions enabled
2.) add a get path to "/"
3.) add a gemfile and bundle install required gems

Adding an Index Page
1.) add a cms filesystem called "data" containing "about.txt", "history.txt", and "changes.txt"
2.) create a file for the index page called views/index.erb
3.) add code which will render the contents of "data" inside index.erb

Viewing Text Files
1.) add content to the files contained in the "data" folder
2.) make each <li> on index.erb a link to a page which will display the contents of that file

Adding Tests
1.) add minitest to the Gemfile
2.) create test/cms_test.rb and add setup code
3.) create a test that performs a get request to "/", validates that the response is successful, and validates that the response contains the names of the three text files
4.) create a test that performs a get request to '/changes.txt' and contains the text 'something'

Handle Requests for Nonexistent Documents
1.) Check to see if a file exists before attempting to read in its content.
2.) If a document doesn't exist, store an error message in the session and redirect the user.
3.) In the index template, if there is error message, print it out and delete it.
