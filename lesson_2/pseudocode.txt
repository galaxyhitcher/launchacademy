1.) a method that returns the sum of two integers

Given two integers as arguments

Return the sum of these arguments.

START

GIVEN an integer a, an integer b

RETURN a + b

2.) a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

loop through a given array of strings, adding each string to a result string, then return that result string

START

GIVEN an array of strings string_array

SET final_string = the first string in the array

SET index = 0

WHILE index < the length of the array
  
  append the string at that index in the input array to final_string

RETURN final_string

3.) a method that takes an array of integers and returns a new array with every other element

Loop through an array of integers, keeping track of the index.
If the index is divisible by two, add the element to a final array.
Return the final array.

START

GIVEN an array of integers array_of_ints

SET i = 0

SET result_array = an empty array

WHILE i < length of array_of_ints

  IF i is even, add the element of array_of_ints at that index to result_array

RETURN result_array
